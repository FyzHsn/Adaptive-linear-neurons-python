Adaptive-linear-neurons-python
==============================  

This repo contains notes and algorithms related to the Adaptive Linear Neurons (ADALINE) algorithm.

adaline.py - algorithm  
adaline_script.py - the script in which I test various properties of Adaline
Adaline_notes.Rmd - playing with Adaline in R
[Adaline_notes.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FyzHsn/Adaptive-linear-neurons-python/blob/master/Adaline_notes.html) - html file corresponding to the Rmd file 

Questions that I am interested in:  
1. Learning rate and convergence of the cost function.  
2. Differences when applied to separable and non-separable data.  
3. Differences when applied to standardized vs its non-standard dataset counterpart.  
4. How are the cost and error function updated?  

I have explored these topics in the html file.
